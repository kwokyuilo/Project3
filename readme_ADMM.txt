1.	A module that constructs the graph of investigated models in tensorflow (cifar_models.py)
2.	Python implementation of ADMM-based sparse CNN (ADMM_cifar.py)
3.	Utility functions for use with the ADMM algorithm. There are functions to load Cifar10 data and to apply norm-0 sparsity promoting penalty functions(ADMMutils.py)
4.	Pre-trained weights in ckpt format (pre-trained folder)
5. CIFAR-10 will be auto-download in .data/cifar-10-binary/ folder if not existed
